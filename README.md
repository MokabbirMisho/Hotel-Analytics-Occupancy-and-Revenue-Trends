# Hotel-Analytics-Occupancy-and-Revenue-Trends

**Objeective:** The primary objective of this project is to analyze the hotel's booking and revenue data to understand the reasons behind the decline in revenue and customer retention. By closely examining booking patterns, occupancy rates, customer ratings, and revenue figures, we aim to uncover insights and trends that will assist the hotel management.

**Description:** In this project, we performed an extensive analysis of hotel bookings data. The main steps involved data import, exploration, cleaning, transformation, and insights generation. Below is a summary of the processes and key findings:

- Data Import and Exploration: We loaded the datasets and explored the bookings, hotels, and aggregate bookings data to understand the structure and identify unique and relevant fields.

- Data Cleaning: We addressed invalid data points, such as negative guest numbers and unrealistic revenue values, by filtering and removing outliers. Missing values were handled appropriately, such as replacing null capacities with the median 
  value.

- Data Transformation: We created new columns to calculate occupancy percentages and merged different dataframes to enrich our dataset for deeper analysis.

**Insights Generation:**

- Occupancy Rates: We calculated average occupancy rates for different room classes and cities. The analysis showed which room classes and cities had higher occupancy.
- Weekday vs. Weekend Occupancy: We analyzed occupancy rates based on the day type to identify trends in booking patterns.
- Monthly Analysis: We specifically looked at June occupancy and appended new data for August to keep our analysis current.
- Revenue Analysis: We examined revenue realized per city, hotel type, and booking platform, identifying the most profitable segments.
- Ratings: We also assessed the average ratings per city to understand customer satisfaction.
- This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for hotel management, helping them optimize their operations, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts based on the data-driven findings.
